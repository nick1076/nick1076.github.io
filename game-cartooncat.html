										<h2>Cartoon Cat</h2>
											<p><b>Cartoon Cat was the first ever official indie game I released, releasing on the itch.io platform in late 2022. I developed the game entirely solo over the course of a few weeks much earlier and ultimately on a wim decided to throw it out there for people to see much after development had finished. It ended up garnering a plethora of positive views with over 1000 downloads which shocked me. On this page, I detail its release, player feedback/reviews, and also its development.</b></p>

										<h2>Outcome & Analytics of Release</h2>
											<p><b>I ended up actually releasing this game on October 8th, 2022, about a year later than when I finished it. I decided to take this leap since I had nothing to lose and it would be better than simply keeping it to rot on my desktop. I ended up releasing it to itch.io (Popular distributer) and it ended up being a huge sucsess and taking off. Here is it's official store page:</b></p>

                                            <p><b>Within the first day, 3 seperate YouTuber's ended up making a let's play/gameplay walkthrough of the entire game, and I was thrilled by this. Launch day with 0 marketing received around 79 views and 21 downloads, with day two continuing and even beating day 1. Here are some of the videos people made:</b></p>

                                            <p><b>On top of the videos, on day one, I recieved a 5 star review and many wonderful comments. This all gave me both experience in releasing a game and taught me a few things that I could change for future releases. Since the game was considered to be a "demo" and the end of the game upon beating it told the player that a full release was in development, this demo release set me up for a later release of a full game.</b></p>
