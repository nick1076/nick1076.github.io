<h1>Final Project</h1>

<p>My final project is a voltage-reading device which communicates via USB through FTDI to a software on your computer to display the current voltage being read. It features an ATTiny 412 as the microcontroller.</p>

<h3>Day 1 (12/1/22)</h3>

<p>Today I began and finished my KiCad PCB board design for my project. I created a schematic which would run off of an ATTiny412 and which included an analog voltage sensor as well as RX/TX pinouts to communicate with an FTDI board. I milled it out and you can see my schematic, PCB view, and the final mill result.</p>

<h3>Day 2 (12/9/22)</h3>

<p>Today, I soldered on an ATTiny 412 for the microcontroller and a set of 4x1 horizontal pin headers. I then connected it to an arduino, made the arduino a programmer, and programmed my ATTiny with a blank file just to make sure everything was soldered correctly, which it was and it worked.</p>
